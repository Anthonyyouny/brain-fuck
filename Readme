This is a folder about brain f**k.

It begun with the pwn `brain f**k` in pwnable.kr
It has been exploited with pwntools , you can run `python bf.py` to get the flag.
the main idea for the exploit is 'replace the got',to run `system('/bin/sh')`.

And the rest file is a bf2c emulation and an example.`bf2c.cpp` translate bf to c,and you can run it of course.

:P
